# Simple mini Task Manager 

A Python project that helps you understand basic concepts such as input handling, lists, loops, and conditionals.

## ðŸ’¡ What It Does

- Lets users add tasks
- Lists all current tasks
- Deletes a selected task
- Runs in an infinite loop until the user exits

## ðŸ§  Learning Focus

At the top of a Python file, we usually write:
1. Libraries, imports, modules  
2. Database connections  
3. Constant variables  
Then comes the main program logic.

This project demonstrates:
- Working with lists
- Using `while True` loops
- Taking user input and handling choices
- Deleting items from a list using `.pop()`

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Save the script as `task_manager.py`.
3. Run it in your terminal:

```bash
python task_manager.py
